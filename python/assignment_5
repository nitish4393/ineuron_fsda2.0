1. Empty Dictionary:

Code: {}
2. Value with Key 'foo':

Access: my_dict['foo']
Value: 42 (in your example)
3. Dictionary vs. List:

Dictionaries: Unordered key-value pairs. Accessed by keys.
Lists: Ordered collections of items. Accessed by numerical index.
4. Accessing with a Nonexistent Key:

Results in a KeyError exception.
5. Difference between 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys():

'cat' in spam: Checks for 'cat' as a key within the entire dictionary.
'cat' in spam.keys(): Explicitly checks for 'cat' only amongst keys. (More explicit, but often unnecessary as they typically yield the same result.)
6. Difference between 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.values():

'cat' in spam: Checks for 'cat' as a key.
'cat' in spam.values(): Checks for 'cat' as a value within the dictionary.
7. Shortcut for Conditional Key-Value Assignment:

spam.setdefault('color', 'black')
8. Pretty-Printing Dictionaries:

Use the pprint module:
Import: import pprint
Print: pprint.pprint(my_dict)
