Relative path: A relative path refers to the location of a file or directory relative to the current working directory.

Absolute path: An absolute path starts with the root directory of the file system on the operating system. In Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS), it typically starts with a forward slash (/), while in Windows, it usually starts with a drive letter followed by a colon (e.g., C:).

os.getcwd() and os.chdir():

os.getcwd(): Returns the current working directory as a string.
os.chdir(path): Changes the current working directory to the specified path.
. and .. folders:

. represents the current directory.
.. represents the parent directory.
In C:\bacon\eggs\spam.txt, C:\bacon\eggs is the dir name, and spam.txt is the base name.

Modes for open() function:

'r': Read mode (default). Opens a file for reading.
'w': Write mode. Opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, it will be truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.
'a': Append mode. Opens a file for writing. If the file already exists, new data will be appended to the end of the file.
If an existing file is opened in write mode ('w'), its previous contents will be overwritten. If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.

The read() method reads the entire contents of a file as a single string, while the readlines() method reads the contents of the file line by line and returns a list where each element is a line of text.

A shelf value in Python resembles a dictionary data structure. It is a persistent, dictionary-like object that stores key-value pairs on disk.
