1. RGBA Stands For:

Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. RGBA is a color format that represents each pixel in an image using four channels:
Red, Green, and Blue channels determine the color intensity (0-255 for each).
Alpha channel defines the transparency level (0-255, 0 being fully transparent, 255 being fully opaque).

2. Getting RGBA Values (Pillow):

There are two main approaches to get RGBA values of image pixels in Pillow:

Accessing Individual Pixels:

Python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open("image.png")
width, height = img.size  # Get image dimensions

# Access a specific pixel's RGBA values (x, y coordinates)
x = 100
y = 50
r, g, b, a = img.getpixel((x, y))
print(f"Pixel at ({x}, {y}): RGBA = ({r}, {g}, {b}, {a})")
Use code with caution.
Iterating Over All Pixels:

Python
for x in range(width):
    for y in range(height):
        r, g, b, a = img.getpixel((x, y))
        # Process RGBA values for each pixel here
Use code with caution.

3. Box Tuple:

A box tuple is a 4-element tuple representing a rectangular area in an image. It's used in many Pillow functions to define regions of interest or areas for drawing.

The format is: (left, top, right, bottom), where:

left: X-coordinate of the top-left corner.
top: Y-coordinate of the top-left corner.
right: X-coordinate of the bottom-right corner (one pixel beyond the last pixel).
bottom: Y-coordinate of the bottom-right corner (one pixel beyond the last pixel).
Example: box = (10, 20, 150, 80) defines a rectangle with top-left at (10, 20) and bottom-right at (149, 79).

4. Image Width and Height:

Python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open("image.png")  # Replace with your image path

# Get image dimensions
width, height = img.size
print(f"Image width: {width}, Image height: {height}")
Use code with caution.

5. Excluding Lower-Left Quarter:

To get a new Image object excluding the lower-left quarter (assuming width and height are already retrieved):

Python
quarter_width = width // 4
quarter_height = height // 4

box = (0, 0, width, height - quarter_height)  # Exclude lower-left quarter
new_img = img.crop(box)  # Create a new image with the cropped area
Use code with caution.

6. Saving Modified Image:

Python
new_img.save("modified_image.png")  # Replace with your desired filename
Use code with caution.

7. Pillow's Shape-Drawing Module:

The PIL.ImageDraw module provides functionalities for drawing shapes on an Image object.

8. Drawing on Images:

Image objects themselves don't have drawing methods. You create a Draw object associated with an Image object to perform drawing operations.
Python
from PIL import Image, ImageDraw

img = Image.open("image.png")
draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)  # Create a Draw object associated with the image

# Draw a rectangle (example)
draw.rectangle((100, 50, 200, 100), fill="red", outline="blue")

# Save the modified image
img.save("image_with_shapes.png")
Use code with caution.
Remember to replace "image.png" with your actual image file path in these examples.
